First of all, I am sorry. I was not able to commit regularlly. I use Kaggle environment. Kaggle is a colud based environment. 
Therefore it is not possible to use the github directly to commit and push.I tried to set up the environment using some third partes, but failed.
You will get clear idea about my thinking and approach in the notebook. Everything is markdown in the notebook.
